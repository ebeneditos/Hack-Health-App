## Authors: Ernest Benedito, Gonzalo Espinosa & Sandra Orozco

On the 25th and 26th of November of 2016 a Hackathon took place in the campus of the UPC of Terrassa. It was organized by the [City Hall of Terrassa](http://www.terrassa.cat/es/hack-health) with the collaboration of [Synergic Partners](http://www.synergicpartners.com/en/hackhealth-el-ayuntamiento-de-terrassa-organiza-el-primer-hackathon-de-big-data-y-salud-con-la-colaboracion-de-synergic-partners/), a Big Data and Data Science consulting firm, part of the Telef√≥nica group.

The aim of the Hackathon was to find a solution to improve the quality of life of the citizens. Several data was provided from hospitals from the city and applications that focus on health such as Healthapp.

## Solution

Our proposal was to develop a mobile app which helped therapists that had patients with eating disorders. These kind of patients need to have a close follow-up, as they are prone to having critical episodes. Thus, with the data provided, we built an app that helped the therapist  with the following tools:
1. A quick view of the patient's performance in therms of eating frequency and activity recording.
2. A prediction with the percentage of probability of a patient to have an episode for a given day.
